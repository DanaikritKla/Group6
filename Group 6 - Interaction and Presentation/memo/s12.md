## Problem
1. Tight Coupling
2. Scalability
3. Code Duplication

## Solution 
1. Apply the principle of separation of concerns by clearly defining the responsibilities of each component in the architecture. This helps to reduce tight coupling and promotes modularity.
2. Implement an event-driven design approach where components communicate through events or messages. This allows for looser coupling and easier scalability.
3.  Utilize design patterns, such as observer pattern or mediator pattern, to manage interactions between components effectively and reduce code duplication.
