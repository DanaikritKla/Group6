## Problem
1. Inconsistent user interface elements and terminology across different screens or sections of the software.
2. Lack of shortcuts or efficient ways for frequent users to perform actions.
3. Insufficient feedback to users after performing actions.
4. Poor error handling and error messages that are difficult to understand.
5. Lack of support for undoing actions or reverting to previous states.
6. Users feeling a lack of control over the system.
7. Overloading users' short-term memory with complex displays or excessive information.


## Solution 
1. Strive for consistency throughout the interface.
2. Provide shortcuts and customizable options for efficient interactions.
3. Offer informative feedback to confirm user actions.
4. Improve error handling with clear messages and suggested solutions.
5. Enable easy reversal of actions to reduce anxiety and encourage exploration. Provide an undo feature or allow users to easily revert to previous states or configurations, especially for actions that have significant consequences.
6. Support an internal locus of control by designing the system to make users the initiators of actions. Provide clear affordances and feedback that show users their actions have an impact on the system and that the system responds accordingly.
7. Simplify displays and minimize cognitive load.
