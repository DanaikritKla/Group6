## Problem
1. Difficulty in maintaining loose coupling between data abstraction and its presentations.
2. The need for frequent changes in interfaces, especially in specific view presentations.
3. Lack of direct connections between the abstraction and presentation components within each agent.

## Solution 
1. Use a control module that plays a central role in mediating the data module and view presentation modules. This helps in maintaining loose coupling and handling communications between the modules.
2. Implement a hierarchical architecture like Presentation-Abstraction-Control (PAC) or Model-View-Controller (MVC). These architectures provide clear structure organization and flow controls, making it easier to manage changes in interfaces.
3.  Divide the system into cooperating agents within the PAC architecture. Each agent consists of three components: Presentation, Abstraction, and Control. The Control component handles communication with other agents, while the Presentation and Abstraction components focus on their specific tasks.

## Decision Driver
1. Loose coupling and communication management.
2. Structural organization and interface management.
3. Modularity and communication between components.
