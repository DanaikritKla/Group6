## Problem
1. The repository architecture, while efficient for sharing large amounts of data, poses a single point of failure and can lead to inefficiencies in organizing all communication through the repository.

## Solution for problem 
1.  Introduce redundancy and fault-tolerant mechanisms in the repository architecture to address the single point of failure issue. Distribute the repository across multiple computers to ensure high availability and reliability. 


## Decision Driver
- Non-functional requirements
