## Problem
1. Lack of clear division between the View and the Controller in some cases.
2. Multiple pairs of controllers and views based on the same data model can make changes to the data model expensive.
3. Not suitable for agent-oriented applications such as interactive mobile and robotics applications.
4. In PAC architecture, the control bridge between presentation and abstraction, and the communication of controls among agents can introduce overhead.
5. It can be difficult to determine the right number of agents in PAC due to loose coupling and high independence among agents.
6. Complete separation of presentation and abstraction by control in each agent can lead to development complexity.

## Solution 
1. Ensure clear and well-defined responsibilities for the View and the Controller components to avoid confusion.
2. Carefully design the data model and consider the impact of changes before implementing them.
3. For agent-oriented applications, consider alternative architectural styles that better suit the requirements, such as behavior-driven architectures.
4. Optimize the control bridge and communication mechanisms in PAC to minimize overhead.
5. Perform thorough analysis and design to determine the appropriate number of agents based on the system's requirements and constraints.
6. Use effective communication mechanisms and protocols between agents to manage the complexity of interaction and control.

## Decision Driver
1. Clarity of responsibilities.
2. Data consistency.
3. Application requirements.
4. Performance.
5. Complexity management.
6. Code organization.
