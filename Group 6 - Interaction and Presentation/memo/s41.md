## Problem
1. User interface design

## Solution 
1. User interface design must integrate user interaction and information presentation.

## Decision Driver
- The Design of User Interaction Modalities
- The Design of Information Presentation
- User Interface Design Process
- Localization and Internationalization
- Metaphors and Conceptual Models

## Remark
- User interface design is an essential part of the software design process. User interface design should ensure that interaction between the human and the machine provides for effective operation and control of the machine. For software to achieve its full potential, the user interface should be designed to match the skills, experience, and expectations of its anticipated users.
