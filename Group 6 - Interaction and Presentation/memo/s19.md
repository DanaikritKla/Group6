2.Establish consistent design patterns and guidelines for views across the application to ensure a cohesive user experience. Maintain uniformity in terms of layout, styling, and interaction patterns.
3.Design the controller to handle events efficiently and effectively. Utilize event-driven programming techniques and frameworks to manage and propagate events to the relevant components.
