## Problem
1. Lack of problems in telling the structure of the presentation
2. There are no recommended features.
3. Lack of interest in the written work
4. There are too many structured contents.

## Solution 
1. Start by outlining the main points or sections of your presentation. Clearly define the introduction, main body, and conclusion.
Use headings and subheadings to organize your content and make it easier to follow.
Consider using visual aids such as slides or diagrams to visually represent the structure of your presentation.
2. Identify key features or recommendations related to your topic.
Incorporate these features throughout your presentation, highlighting their importance and benefits.
Provide examples or case studies that demonstrate how these features have been successfully implemented in relevant contexts.
3. Find ways to make the written work more engaging and appealing to your audience.
Use storytelling techniques to capture their attention and make the content more relatable.
Include real-life examples, anecdotes, or personal experiences that can create a connection with the readers.
Add visuals, such as images or graphs, to break up the text and make it more visually appealing.
4. Evaluate the content and determine what is essential and what can be omitted or condensed.
Focus on the most important points and streamline your presentation to avoid overwhelming your audience.
Prioritize clarity and simplicity in your communication, using concise and straightforward language.
Consider breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable chunks, and provide clear transitions between different sections.
