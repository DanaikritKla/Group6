## Problem
1. Lack of user focus
2. Insufficient understanding of users and tasks
3. Limited user involvement
4. Lack of empirical measurement
5. Inadequate iteration

## Solution 
1. Prioritize the needs and goals of users as the driving force behind the development process.
2. Involve users from the beginning, observe their tasks, and understand their behavior and context of use.
3. Incorporate user testing and observation early in development to gather data on user reactions and performance.
4. Continuously refine the design based on user feedback, fixing identified problems, and carrying out further observations and tests.
5. Consult users throughout the design process, from the earliest phases to the latest, to ensure their input is considered and design decisions are made within the context of users, their work, and their environment.

## Decision Driver
1. User-centered design and user needs prioritization.
2. User research and understanding user behavior.
3. Empirical data collection and user testing.
4. Iterative design process and user feedback incorporation.
5. User involvement and collaboration.
