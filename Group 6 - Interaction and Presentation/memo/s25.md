## Problem
1. The layered architecture pattern suggests organizing components into horizontal layers, where each layer has a specific role and responsibility in the application. 
2. The concept of closed layers means that requests must go through the layer immediately below to reach the next layer below it. 
3. The text mentions that allowing direct access from the presentation layer to the persistence layer or database layer would lead to tightly coupled components and dependencies. 
4. To address this problem, the concept of open layers is introduced. Open layers are exceptions to the closed layer principle, allowing requests to bypass certain layers and directly access the layer below. 
5. By marking the services layer as open, requests from the business layer can bypass it and directly access the persistence layer. This allows for a more logical and efficient flow of requests, avoiding unnecessary layers while maintaining the benefits of isolation and modularity in other parts of the architecture.


## Solution 
1. Identify the critical layers: Determine which layers require strong isolation and should remain closed.
2. Define layer interfaces: Clearly define the interfaces between layers to establish contracts and boundaries.
3. Use dependency inversion: Apply the principle of dependency inversion to decouple layers and promote flexibility. 
4. Consider separation of concerns: Ensure that each layer has a clear and specific responsibility within the application. 
5. Use appropriate design patterns: Explore design patterns that can help address specific challenges within the architecture. 
6. Evaluate he need for open layers: Assess whether there are specific scenarios where open layers would be beneficial. 
7. Maintain architectural governance: Establish guidelines and best practices to govern access and dependencies between layers. 
8. Continuously refactor and improve: As the application evolves and requirements change, regularly review and refactor the architecture to optimize the balance between closed and open layers. 

## Decision Driver
1. Layer identification and role definition.
2. Interface definition and contract establishment.
3. Dependency inversion principle and decoupling layers.
4. Clear responsibility assignment for each layer.
5. Selection and implementation of suitable design patterns.
6. Assessment of scenarios and benefits of open layers.
7. Governance guidelines for layer access and dependencies.
8. Continuous refactoring and optimization of the architecture.
