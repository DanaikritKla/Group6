## Problem
1.Complex View Logic: In traditional MVC, the View component has direct access to the Model and is responsible for reading and displaying data. However, in many web-MVC setups, there is a desire to separate database-related code from HTML. This often leads to a smart controller using a template layer for rendering, which is not a bad design but deviates from the traditional MVC pattern.

## Solution 
1.Hybrid Approaches: Many web applications tend to use a hybrid approach that combines elements of MVC and PAC, which can lead to confusion. It's important to recognize that not all web architectures strictly adhere to MVC principles. For example, Drupal is more of a PAC architecture. Understanding the underlying architecture of the framework or application being used can help in making informed design decisions.

## Decision Driver
recognizing the architectural principles and patterns employed by the framework or application being used.
