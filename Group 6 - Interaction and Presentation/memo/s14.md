4. Engaging users directly, collecting feedback, and continuously iterating on the design based on user input helps improve the user experience and address any identified issues.
5. Using frameworks like the HEART framework, organizations can measure the impact of interaction design on user happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success, allowing for data-driven improvements.
