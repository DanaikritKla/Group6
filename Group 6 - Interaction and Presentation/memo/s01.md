## Problem
1. Discovering users' needs/wants: This stage involves observing and interviewing users to understand their requirements and contexts. It may also involve examining existing solutions and conducting analysis to make sense of the findings.

2. Analyzing: In this stage, designers sort and order the findings from the discovery phase. This analysis can take the form of narratives or task analyses to identify patterns and insights.

3. Designing a potential solution: Based on the analysis, designers create a design for a potential solution. They follow design guidelines and principles, considering factors such as user feedback and navigation.

4. Prototyping: Designers create prototypes of the solution to give users an idea of what the final product will look like. Prototypes can be tested by users or evaluated by experts using heuristics to assess their effectiveness.

5. Implementing and deploying: Once the design and prototype have been validated, designers move forward with implementing and deploying the final product.

## Solution for problem 
1. Conduct user interviews and surveys to gather insights on their requirements and pain points.
Use observation techniques such as usability testing or contextual inquiry to understand users' behaviors and contexts.
Analyze existing solutions and conduct competitive analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses.

2. Sort and order the findings from user research to identify patterns and common themes.
Create personas or user profiles based on the collected data to better understand users' goals and motivations.
Conduct task analysis to identify the steps and interactions involved in users' workflows.

3. Generate design ideas and concepts that address the identified user needs and pain points.
Follow design guidelines and principles to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
Incorporate user feedback obtained from the discovery phase to inform the design decisions.

4. Create low-fidelity prototypes using tools like paper prototyping or digital wireframing tools to quickly iterate on design ideas.
Develop interactive prototypes using prototyping software or coding to provide a more realistic user experience.
Test the prototypes with users to gather feedback and refine the design further.

5. Develop the final product based on the validated design and prototype.
Conduct usability testing during the implementation phase to ensure the product meets user needs and expectations.
Deploy the product to the intended audience, considering factors such as platform compatibility and user onboarding.

## Remark
- the problem-solving process in that it follows a user-centered design approach. By emphasizing the importance of discovering users' needs/wants, analyzing findings, and designing a potential solution based on user feedback and navigation, the process ensures that the final product is tailored to meet the requirements and contexts of the users. This user-centered approach increases the likelihood of creating a solution that effectively addresses the identified problems and provides a positive user experience.
