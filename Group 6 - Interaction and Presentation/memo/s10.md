## Problem
1. Poor Usability
2. Lack of User Feedback
3. Inefficient Navigation
4. Inconsistent Interaction Patterns
5. Information Overload
6. Accessibility Issues

## Solution 
1. Conduct user research to understand user needs, behaviors, and preferences. Test the system with real users to identify usability issues and gather feedback for improvement.
2. Provide users with clear and timely feedback on their actions, such as visual cues, notifications, or progress indicators.
3. Design a clear and intuitive navigation structure that enables users to find information or features easily. Use consistent labeling and organization principles.
4. Establish consistent interaction and design patterns throughout the system to provide familiarity and reduce cognitive load.
5. Organize information in a hierarchical manner, prioritizing essential content and breaking it into manageable chunks to prevent information overload.
6. Ensure the system meets accessibility standards and guidelines, including support for assistive technologies, proper color contrast, and keyboard accessibility.

## Decision Driver
1. User-centered design.
2. User feedback and engagement.
3. Information architecture and navigation.
4. User interface (UI) design and consistency.
5. Information design and content organization.
6. Accessibility compliance and inclusivity.
