2. Overwhelming users with too much information or options.
3. Insufficient feedback on system status and user actions.

## Solution 
1. Conduct user research to gain a clear understanding of users' goals and incorporate that understanding into the design process.
2. Limit options and present essential information to provide a clear and uncluttered display. Use strong information scent to guide users towards their desired tasks.
3. Provide informative feedback to users to confirm the success of their actions, guide them through processes, and reduce uncertainty.
