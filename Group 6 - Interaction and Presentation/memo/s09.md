## Problem
1. Complex behavior prediction and control
2. Rigid software interfaces
3. Error handling and tolerance
4. Unknown and dynamic interactions

## Solution 
1. Use higher-level abstractions like social commitments and team intentions to define interactions among components more robustly, allowing for flexibility in inputs and outputs.
2. Design components as interacting agents capable of entering into social commitments, changing their mind about results, negotiating with others, and collaborating in teams.
3. Agents should be long-lived and persistent to detect and resolve errors that may manifest later in execution. They should be able to explore their way out of livelocks and dynamically adapt to complex environments.
4. Agents should be able to detect errors and opportunities, explore different solutions, and exploit errors when necessary to facilitate progress in complex environments.

## Decision Driver
1. Behavior modeling and robust interaction definition.
2. Agent-based design and interaction capabilities.
3. Error handling and resilience.
4. Adaptability and exploration.
