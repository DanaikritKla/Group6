## Problem
1. Lack of data hiding and increased dependency in an object-oriented architecture.

## Solution for problem 
1.  Applying the "Client-Server" architectural style can address these issues. By introducing a server component, clients no longer need to know the identities of other clients or servers. 

## Decision Driver
- The decision to address the performance issue is driven by the recognition that the broker architecture has become a bottleneck.

## Remark
- Process control architectures excel in systems that require precise control over physical processes. However, designing and implementing such architectures can be complex and require expertise in the specific domain. Proper analysis, modeling, and testing are crucial to ensure the desired behavior and performance of the system.
