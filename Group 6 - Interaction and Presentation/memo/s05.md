## Problem
1. Lack of clarity in the division between the View and the Controller in MVC.
2. Expensive data model changes in MVC due to multiple pairs of controllers and views.
3. Overhead and complexity in PAC architecture due to control bridges and communication among agents.

## Solution for problem 
1. To address this challenge, it is important to establish clear responsibilities and boundaries for the View and Controller components. 
2. To mitigate the challenge of costly data model changes, it is essential to design the data model with flexibility in mind. This can be achieved by following principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and abstraction.
3. To mitigate the overhead and complexity in PAC architecture, it is crucial to carefully design the control mechanisms and communication protocols between agents.

## Remark
- The paragraph discusses two major interaction-oriented software architectures, MVC and PAC, and their components. The solutions provided focus on establishing clear boundaries between components, designing flexible data models, and optimizing control mechanisms and communication protocols. By implementing these solutions, software projects can overcome challenges related to clarity, maintainability, and complexity, resulting in more effective and efficient interactive applications.
