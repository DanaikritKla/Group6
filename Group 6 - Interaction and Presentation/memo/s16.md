## Problem
1.Misrepresentation of tools claiming to be based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture: Many tools claim to be based on the MVC architecture, but the blog points out that this claim is not entirely accurate.

## Solution 
1.Properly understand the architectural differences: Recognize that the PAC architecture is an extension of MVC and is suitable for GUI applications with complex substructures that require their own specialized interaction.

## Decision Driver
- the PAC is suitable for GUI applications with complex substructures
