## Problem
1. Develop a software module with logical cohesion that handles different print functions generating different output reports. The module should arrange these print functions into a single cohesive unit where elements contribute to activities of the same general category. Ensure that the module's elements are selected from outside the module, allowing flexibility in choosing which specific reports to generate.

## Solution for problem 
1. Identify the types of output reports needed design separate functions or modules for each report type implement a central module for selecting and generating reports allow flexibility by selecting report type externally coordinate activities within the central module and test thoroughly for accuracy and efficiency

## Decision Driver
- Resource allocation

## Remark
- The proposed solution addresses the problem of developing a software module with logical cohesion for handling different print functions generating different output reports. By structuring the module with individual report generation functions and a central coordinator function, the solution ensures that elements within the module contribute to activities of the same general category. The flexibility to select specific reports to generate enhances the module's usability. Overall, the solution effectively tackles the problem while promoting modular design and maintainability.
